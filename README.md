## Getting started 

- Clone the repo
- (Suggested) Create and activate virtual environment
- Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Download some historic trading data and place it in the `data` dir 
    - for now table columns assume data is from Yahoo Finance
    - navigate there to get data like the EUR/USD quotes history in csv
- Update tablename and filepath in `fishstick.py` and execute 

## Download using code 

testing an additional package `yfinance` to see if direct python downloads can be used in future.
